# Leiten

This is the mobile app Leiten.

My Girlfriend and I have built a huge list of restaurants and places around chicago
we like, and whenever people I know from the east coast are coming through 
Chicago, I send them the Doc. But that doesnâ€™t give them much info and 
in terms of format it could be more user friendly.

I decided I wanted an app that would let people I know easily see our recommendations,
and a separate client that would allow easy submission of reccs by myself or my girlfriend.

This app was built on React-Native/Expo, React-Native-Maps, Redux, Native-Base, Firebase/Firestore 
over three days for a hackathon. The data submission web app is on a branch.
